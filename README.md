[![Deploy to Heroku](https://github.com/Too-Hot-To-Hindle/Social_Distribution_Media/actions/workflows/heroku.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Too-Hot-To-Hindle/Social_Distribution_Media/actions/workflows/heroku.yml)

# Social_Distribution_Media

See below section **Project Part 1 Summary** for project progress thus far.

[Deployed App](https://social-distribution-media.herokuapp.com/) | [API Documentation](https://social-distribution-media.herokuapp.com/api/schema/swagger-ui/)

[Project implementation](https://github.com/abramhindle/CMPUT404-project-socialdistribution/blob/master/project.org) of a social network using the inbox model.

## Running Instructions

Our app uses a React frontend and Django backend. The frontend code is built and copied to the `backend/build` directory, which is served when running the Django app.

When making changes, the new version is automatically built and depolyed to Heroku by a [github action](https://github.com/Too-Hot-To-Hindle/Social_Distribution_Media/blob/main/.github/workflows/heroku.yml).

### React Setup

#### Install packages

`cd frontend`

`npm install`

#### Copy build files to Django project

`npm run relocate`

This will build the app and copy the `/build` folder to `/backend/build`, where Django will serve it.

> **_NOTE:_** You can also use `npm run start`, but this won't have access to the backend

### Django Setup

#### Virtual Environment

`cd backend`

Create a virtual environment

e.g. `virtualenv venv`

Activate the environment

`. venv/bin/activate`

Install all the required packages

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### Local DB

Run intial migrations

`python manage.py migrate`

Create Superuser

`python manage.py createsuperuser`

#### Run App

`python manage.py runserver`

# Project Part 1 - Summary

## Total Project
- Current state of project is deployed and functional on [Heroku](https://social-distribution-media.herokuapp.com/).
- Basic auth is required to make requests to our API for endpoints where required, and frontend relies on some cookies/local storage objects to make requests where needed. Currently in a proof of concept stage, will be reinforcing in later project parts.
- **21/43** user stories completed (both frontend and backend), with progress made towards multiple others:
    - As an author, I want to like posts that I can access.
    - As an author, I want to befriend local authors.
    - As a server admin, I want a restful interface for most operations.
    - As an author, when I befriend someone (they accept my friend request) I follow them, only when the other author befriends me do I count as a real friend â€“ a bi-directional follow is a true friend.
    - As an author, I want to know if I have friend requests.
    - As an author, I want to use my web browser to manage my profile.
    - As an author, my server will know about my friends.
    - As an author, I want to be able to delete my own public posts.
    - As a server admin, I want to host multiple authors on my server.
    - As an author, I want to be able to use my web browser to manage/author my posts.
    - As a server admin, I want to be able to add, modify, and remove authors.
    - As an author, I want to make public posts.
    - As an author, posts I create can link to images.
    - As an author, I want to edit public posts.
    - As an author, posts I make can be in plain text.
    - As a server admin, images can be hosted on my server.
    - As an author, posts I create can be images.
    - As an authors, posts I create can be in CommonMark.
    - As an author, I want to be able to make posts that are unlisted, that are publicly shareable by URI alone (or for embedding images)
    - As an author, I want to comment on posts I can access
    - As an author, other cannot modify my public posts

    - **Progress made towards the following other user stories:**
        - As an author, posts I create can be private to another author (frontend began, backend/auth work continuing)
        - As an author, posts I create can be private to my friends (frontend began, backend/auth work continuing)
        - As an author, I should be able to browse the public posts of everyone (technically possible, but Search feature in frontend doesn't query posts yet, so it's a little inaccessible without URIs)
        - As an author, comments on friend posts are private only to me the author (comments functionality largely begun, need to add user scopes in backend)
        - As an author, I want un-befriend local and remote authors (backend for local friend removal set up, need to integrate in frontend)
        - As an author, when someone sends me a friends only-post I want to see the likes (backend for likes setup, still need to setup scopes, need to integrate in frontend)
        - As an author, I want a consistent identity per server (local server identity setup)

## Code Base
Code base and project structure is cleanly organized, with frontend and backend aspects of projects sitting in `frontend/` and `backend/` respectively. As per development environment configration instructions in `README.md`, project can easily be cloned and run locally using the `Makefile`.

## Test Cases
Postman tests are setup for the majority of endpoints currently setup for the above completed and in-progress user stories. We have also begun writing unit and UI tests, in `frontend/src/App.test.js`.


## UI
UI is cleanly organized, and provides multiple loading and status indicators. Progress made in frontend in tightly couple with progress made in backend, with a few extra strucutal pieces setup in the frontend for look and feel that we'll later integrate. A Figma diagram has been planned out and created in `UI Design Mockups.png`. 

## Tool Use
GitHub has been extensively used, majorily for version control, but also through the use of GitHub Issues and Projects to track user stories progress. All group members have made contributions to the repository for this project part. Our Heroku project architecture has already been stood up, and functional with a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline. 

## TA Demo
Yet to come!

## Web Service API & Documentation
Backend project strucutre is cleanly organized all in the `backend/` directory, with comments. Open API specification exists and has examples, and can be found (deployed) (here)[https://social-distribution-media.herokuapp.com/api/schema/swagger-ui/].

## Design
Overall project has been designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind, pulling inspiration from other popular social networking sites. Plans were created and followed for frontend development, and backend development for this project part was designed to follow as closely to spec as possible with careful consideration for feature extension.
